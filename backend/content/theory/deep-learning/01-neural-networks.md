# Neural Networks: Fundamentals

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They form the foundation of deep learning, enabling machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

## Basic Structure

A neural network consists of:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data
2. **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or decision

Each layer contains multiple neurons (or nodes), and each connection between neurons has an associated weight.

## The Neuron

The fundamental unit of a neural network is the neuron, which:

1. Receives inputs ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$)
2. Multiplies each input by a weight ($w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$)
3. Sums the weighted inputs and adds a bias ($b$)
4. Passes the result through an activation function ($f$)

Mathematically represented as:

$$y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\right)$$

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns:

- **Sigmoid**: $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$
- **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: $\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}$
- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: $f(z) = \max(0, z)$
- **Leaky ReLU**: $f(z) = \max(\alpha z, z)$ where $\alpha$ is a small constant
- **Softmax**: $\sigma(z)_j = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{z_k}}$ for multi-class classification

## Feedforward Process

In a feedforward neural network, information flows from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer:

1. The input layer receives the feature vector $X$
2. Each hidden layer computes: $H_l = f(W_l H_{l-1} + b_l)$
3. The output layer produces the prediction: $\hat{Y} = f(W_o H_L + b_o)$

Where:
- $H_l$ is the output of layer $l$
- $W_l$ and $b_l$ are the weights and biases of layer $l$
- $f$ is the activation function

## Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the difference between the network's predictions and the actual targets:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: $L = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$
- **Binary Cross-Entropy**: $L = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}[y_i\log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i)]$
- **Categorical Cross-Entropy**: $L = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{m}y_{ij}\log(\hat{y}_{ij})$

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks:

1. Forward pass: Compute the network's output and the loss
2. Backward pass: Calculate gradients of the loss with respect to weights and biases
3. Update parameters using gradient descent: $\theta = \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta}L$

Where:
- $\theta$ represents the parameters (weights and biases)
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\nabla_{\theta}L$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters

## Gradient Descent Variants

- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Updates parameters using the entire dataset
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Updates parameters using a single sample
- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Updates parameters using a small batch of samples
- **SGD with Momentum**: Adds momentum term to accelerate convergence
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rate method that combines momentum and RMSprop

## Implementation in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(
    optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

# Train model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=0
)

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

## Regularization Techniques

To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques are employed:

- **L1 Regularization**: Adds the sum of absolute weights to the loss
- **L2 Regularization**: Adds the sum of squared weights to the loss
- **Dropout**: Randomly sets a fraction of inputs to zero during training
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes layer inputs to stabilize training
- **Early Stopping**: Stops training when validation metrics start degrading

## Network Architectures

Various neural network architectures have been developed for specific tasks:

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Basic feedforward network
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specialized for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Process sequential data
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Advanced RNN for long-term dependencies
- **Transformers**: Self-attention based networks for sequence processing

## Conclusion

Neural networks provide a powerful framework for learning complex patterns in data. Understanding their fundamental principles is essential for effectively applying and innovating in deep learning.
