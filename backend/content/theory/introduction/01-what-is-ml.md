# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Key Concepts

Machine learning works by detecting patterns in data. These patterns are then used to:
- Make predictions
- Classify new data
- Generate insights

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Works with labeled data
   - Examples: [[supervised-learning|Classification and Regression]]
   - Great for prediction tasks

2. **Unsupervised Learning** 
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Useful for finding hidden patterns

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learning through trial and error
   - Agent learns from environment
   - Optimal for games and robotics

## Mathematical Foundation

A simple linear regression can be represented as:

$y = mx + b$

For more complex models, we might use matrices:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1m} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \cdots & x_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \\
w_2 \\
\vdots \\
w_m
\end{bmatrix}
$$
